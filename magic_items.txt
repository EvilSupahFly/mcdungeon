# Magic Items
# 
# These are specific enchanted items that can be included in loot tables.
# Note that any sort of item/enchantment combo is possible. Not everything
# works in the game and care should be taken as some combinations may have
# unexpected results. 
#
# You can use the colored armours from dye_colors.txt. Names will be used
# in-game.
#
# NOTE: Items that cannot normally be enchanted will not appear enchanted
# in multiplayer, even though they still work. (Untested - this may now work.)
