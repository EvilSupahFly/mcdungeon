# Magic Items
# 
# These are specific enchanted items that can be included in loot tables.
# Note that any sort of item/enchantment combo is possible. Not everything
# works in the game and care should be taken as some combinations may have
# unexpected results. 
#
# NOTE names do not actually appear in game, they are only used to identify
# the item in teh loot tables.
#
# NOTE 2: Items that cannot normally be enchanted will not appear enchanted
# in multiplayer, even though they still work.
