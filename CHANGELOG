v0.0.3 - 4/1/2011

	* Removed --world option and replaced it with a positional argument.

	* Added --interactive option. This will prompt for SAVEDIR, Z, X, 
          and LEVEL

        * Added batch file for windows to start in interactive mode.

        * Added a little more progress feedback.

v0.0.2 - 3/31/2011

	* Added Cookie and Locked Chest to items.txt.

	* Added Cookie to default loot tables.

        * Reworked the --offset option. It now takes three args instead
          if just one. 

	* Z, X, and LEVELS args now accept -1 as a value. This will 
          cause the tool to pick random values for these. Z and X will
          between 2 and the maximum distance between dist_min and dist_max
          in the .cfg file. Levels will be between 2 and 8. This should 
          maximize the chance that the dungeon will fit into the map, 
          unless the map has a ton of very shallow chunks around spawn.

v0.0.1 - 3/30/2011

	* Initial release!
