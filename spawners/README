This folder contains the data for custom spawners. NBT files in this folder
can be referenced as spawner types in dungeon config files. See default.cfg
for more details.

Each custom spawner is an NBT file containing the tags required to create
the spawner object. You may add your own files by editing the defaults
using an NBT editor (like NBTEdit.) It may also be possible to extract
the tags form an existing spawner in a Minecraft level and use that. (But
this has not been tested.)

Spawners can be very simple, or potentially a very complex tree of values.
The most simple example would be a single string tag, called EntityId and
containing the EntityId of the mob you want to spawn. The Id, x, y and z
tags are unnecessary as they are added by MCDungeon.

For more information on the format of the tags see:

IMPORTANT: If you provide Minecraft with incorrect tags, it can potentially
crash it. Please use this feature with caution.
