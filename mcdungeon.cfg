# Remember that Minecraft measures coordinates like this:
# (X, Y, Z)
# X = North-South (negative X is North)
# Y = Down-Up (0=bottom of the world, 127=limit of the sky)
# Z = East-West (negative Z is East)

# World coordinates of the NW corner of the most NW room (x,y,z)
# This is temporary until the site selection algorithm is working. 
# This is NOT the location of the entrance. 
# The entrance position will be chosen from a random room location.
# TODO: provide command line options for this?
# This does not currently check the bounds of the world to make sure the
# dungeon will fit. If you make the dungeon too deep, it will error out. 
offset: (-8,63,67)
# Tower height factor. The entry tower will be scaled by this amount. 
# This should be a positive number. 1.0 = the height of a single floor. 
# Make the tower taller so it's easier to find.

# This is the density of chests per 10 rooms per level, rounded up. 
# For example, a value of 2 will place five chests per level in a 5x5 dungeon.
# (25 rooms, 2 chests per 10 = 5 chests)
# 1 would place three chests per level in a 5x5 dungeon.

# MultiVerse portal destination. 
# This will create a MultiVerse portal (CraftBukkit plugin) at the bottom of
# the dungeon pointing to the world set by this value. Set this to blank if you
# don't wan't a portal exit (players will have to climb out), or if you do not
# run MultiVerse. This required MultiVerse's "signs" function. It has been 
# tested with MV 1.7.

# Feature lists. The following sections control the probablility of a
# particular feature showing up in the algorithm. Each  name is followed
# by a weight that determines the probability that feature  will be
# chosen relative to the others in the list. These numbers do NOT  need
# to add up to 100. They are only relative to each other. For example,
# a weight of 40 is twice as likely to be chosen as a weight of 20.
# These numbers are also not hard, they simply weight the probability
# of  the randomizer. A very low weight may still occasionally be chosen
# more than a high weight, it's just unlikely. A weight of zero means
# that feature will never be chosen.

# Room types. Basic room shape. 
# You should leave Blank zero unless you want sections of the dungeon 
# to be disconnected.

# Mobs for monster spawners.
# There are some non-standard choices here. Choose these at your own
# risk. The may disappear from Minecraft in the future and who knows
# what that will do to old maps containing these entities. 
#
# "Monster" will spawn monsters that look like players. Unexpected and fun!
#
# "Slimes" doesn't work well, because they have special depth requirements. 
# "PigZombie" works, but they don't care about light level and are mostly
#     docile. They will fill up the mob queue quickly. 
#
# This does not affect what critters will spawn naturally within the dungeon.

# Loot tables. There are an arbitrary number of loot "tiers"
# Tier zero is used for any chests located above the ceiling of the topmost
# dungeon level. (like the tower) The highest numbered tier is used for a 
# single chest located at the bottom of the dungeon. All other chests are 
# picked from tier 1 to (n-1) depending on the level depth. Item names are
# taken from items.txt file. 
# 
# Lines are:
# Item Name: (chance to appear),(min),(max)
