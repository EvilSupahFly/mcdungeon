mcdungeon

Mcdungeon will create a procedurally generated world in a prexisting
minecraft map. It is not yet feature complete, but can generate basic
floor layouts. It is written in Python.

CURRENT FEATURES:

   * Generates room layouts based on a random weighted selection
   of rooms. (not yet configurable)

   * Connects rooms with hallways. Hall types are also chosen
   from a random weighted list. (not yet configurable)

   * Places doors, portcullises, and torches in the dungeon.

   * Saves changes (with lighting!) to a Minecraft map via
   pymclevel.

   * Cobblestone has random patches of moss growing on it.

   * Output floors to ANSI terminal.

   * Output floors to an HTML table.

TODO:

   * Floor types
   * Room features
   * Place stairwells between floors
   * Place a dungeon entrance leading to the surface
   * Place monster spawners
   * Place chests with treasure
   * Automatically select a suiable location within a map
   * Expose tweaks to the algorithm via config files

OPTIONS:

$ ./mcdungeon.py --help
usage: mcdungeon.py [-h] [--write] [--skip-relight] [--term Y] [--html Y]
                    --world SAVEDIR
                    z x levels

Generate some DungeonQuest-like dungeons in a Minecraft map.

positional arguments:
  z                Number of rooms East-West
  x                Number of rooms North-South
  levels           Number of levels

optional arguments:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  --write          Write the dungeon to disk
  --skip-relight   Skip relighting the level
  --term Y         Print an text version of slice Y to the terminal
  --html Y         Print an html version of slice Y to the terminal
  --world SAVEDIR  Target world (path to save directory)

EXAMPLES:

This will generate a 4x4x1 dungeon layout and display the results
in a terminal window. (ANSI control codes probably mean *nix sysems
only. Sorry) The base world will not be modified, but a world is 
required to pull in material info, etc. 

./mcdungeon.py --world <path to world> 4 4 1 --term 0
