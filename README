mcdungeon

Mcdungeon will create a procedurally generated dungeon in a prexisting
minecraft map. It is not yet feature complete, but can generate basic
floor layouts. It is written in Python and makes heavy use of code from
Paul Hodge's minetown project and David Rio Vierra's pymclevel.

CURRENT FEATURES:

   * Generates room layouts based on a random weighted selection
     of rooms. 

   * Places stairwells between levels, and a tower entrance with a
     sprialing staircase.

   * Connects rooms with hallways. Hall types are also chosen
     from a random weighted list. 

   * Places random floor decorations form a weighted list.

   * Places room features in rooms. (currently only stairwells and
     the tower entrance exist)

   * Places doors, portcullises, and torches in the dungeon.

   * Places chests with loot around the dungeon in (probably) hard
     to reach places. An arbitrary number of loot tables can be configured
     to provide variety. 

   * Room, hall, floor, and feature lists are configurable via an
     external .cfg file. 

   * Frequency of doors, portcullises, and torches are set via .cfg file. 

   * Saves changes (with lighting!) to a Minecraft map via
     pymclevel.

   * Cobblestone has random patches of moss growing on it.

   * Output floors to ANSI terminal.

   * Output floors to an HTML table.

TODO:

   * More floor types
   * More room features
   * More room types
   * More hall types
   * Place a dungeon entrance leading to the surface (partially complete)
   * Place monster spawners
   * Automatically select a suiable location within a map

OPTIONS:

$ ./mcdungeon.py --help
usage: mcdungeon.py [-h] [--config CFGFILE] [--write] [--skip-relight]
                    [--term Y] [--html Y] --world SAVEDIR
                    z x levels

Generate some DungeonQuest-like dungeons in a Minecraft map.

positional arguments:
  z                 Number of rooms West -> East
  x                 Number of rooms North -> South
  levels            Number of levels

optional arguments:
  -h, --help        show this help message and exit
  --config CFGFILE  Alternate config file. Default: mcdungeon.cfg
  --write           Write the dungeon to disk
  --skip-relight    Skip relighting the level
  --term Y          Print an text version of slice Y to the terminal
  --html Y          Print an html version of slice Y to the terminal
  --world SAVEDIR   Target world (path to save directory)

EXAMPLES:

Load a world named 'Dungeon' in the current directory, generate a
5x4x3 dungeon layout (5 rooms E/W, 4 rooms N/S, and 3 levels deep)
and display the results in a terminal window. (ANSI control codes
probably mean *nix sysems only. Sorry) The base world will not be
modified, but a world is required to pull in material info, etc.

./mcdungeon.py --world Dungeon 5 4 3 --term 0
